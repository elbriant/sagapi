            This API wasn’t built out of necessity—it was crafted out of pure admiration for Saga, the lively wandering
            monk from Higashi! Whether you're checking her stats, skills, or even her iconic food-themed battle cries,
            every piece of data here is a love letter to her infectious energy.</p>
        <p class="text-saga-light text-center max-w-4xl
        text-lg sm:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
            From her accidental enrollment at Rhodes Island to her outgoing personality and bottomless appetite, this
            project is a tribute to Saga in all her delightful chaos. Enjoy! 🍜✨
